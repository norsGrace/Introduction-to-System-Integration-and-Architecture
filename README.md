# Introduction-to-System-Integration-and-Architecture
I expect this subject, System Integration and Architecture, to help me understand how different parts of a computer system work together. Instead of just learning one tool or program, I’m excited to see how software, hardware, and networks connect to create a complete system. I think this will give me a bigger picture of how technology really works in the real world.

I also expect this subject to challenge me to think and solve problems in creative ways. When systems are combined, there can be issues like errors or slow performance, and I want to learn how to fix those problems step by step. I’m also looking forward to group activities where we can share ideas, since working as a team is a big part of building and improving systems.

Lastly, I expect System Integration and Architecture to prepare me for my future career in IT. Many companies need people who know how to connect systems and make them work smoothly, so the lessons here will be very useful. I also hope this subject helps me become more responsible and confident, not just in using technology, but in designing solutions that can really help people
